        This signature is not yet fully standardized and subject to change.

    Returns the expected cube metadata, after applying this UDF, based on input metadata.
    The provided metadata represents the whole raster or vector cube. This function does not need to be called for every data chunk.

    When this function is not implemented by the UDF, the backend may still be able to infer correct metadata by running the
    UDF, but this can result in reduced performance or errors.

    This function does not need to be provided when using the UDF in combination with processes that by design have a clear
    effect on cube metadata, such as :py:meth:`~openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube.reduce_dimension()`
