            values will be computed, one value per contained `Feature`. No values will be computed for empty
            geometries. For example, a single value will be computed for a `MultiPolygon`, but two values will be
            computed for a `FeatureCollection` containing two polygons.  - For **polygons**, the process considers
            all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as
            defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC). - For **points**, the process considers the
            closest pixel center. - For **lines** (line strings), the process considers all the pixels whose
            centers are closest to at least one point on the line.  Thus, pixels may be part of multiple geometries

            pixels (see ``is_valid()``) for each computed value. These values are added as a new dimension. The new
            dimension of type `other` has the dimension labels `value`, `total_count` and `valid_count`.  Fails

            number of values in the source dimension is equal to the number of values computed by the process.

            is not the target dimension. The target dimension exists with a single label only:    - The number of
            dimensions decreases by one as the source dimension is 'dropped' and the target dimension is filled

            name and type remain unchanged. All other dimension properties change as defined in the list below. 3.
            The source dimension is not the target dimension and the latter does not exist:    - The number of
            dimensions remain unchanged, but the source dimension is replaced with the target dimension.    - The
            target dimension has the specified name and the type other. All other dimension properties are set as
            defined in the list below.  Unless otherwise stated above, for the given (target) dimension the
            following applies:  - the number of dimension labels is equal to the number of values computed by the
            process, - the dimension labels are incrementing integers starting from zero, - the resolution changes,

        :param self: The URL to a static STAC catalog (STAC Item, STAC Collection, or STAC Catalog) or a
            specific STAC API Collection that allows to filter items and to download assets. This includes batch
            job results, which itself are compliant to STAC. For external URLs, authentication details such as API
            keys or tokens may need to be included in the URL.  Batch job results can be specified in two ways:  -
            For Batch job results at the same back-end, a URL pointing to the corresponding batch job results
            endpoint should be provided. The URL usually ends with `/jobs/{id}/results` and `{id}` is the
            corresponding batch job ID. - For external results, a signed URL must be provided. Not all back-ends
            support signed URLs, which are provided as a link with the link relation `canonical` in the batch job
            result metadata.
        :param spatial_extent: Limits the data to load to the specified bounding box or polygons.  * For raster
            data, the process loads the pixel into the data cube if the point at the pixel center intersects with
            the bounding box or any of the polygons (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC). * For
            vector data, the process loads the geometry into the data cube if the geometry is fully within the
            bounding box or any of the polygons (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC). Empty
            geometries may only be in the data cube if no spatial extent has been provided.  The GeoJSON can be one
            of the following feature types:  * A `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry, * a `Feature` with a
            `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry, or * a `FeatureCollection` containing at least one `Feature` with
            `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometries.  Set this parameter to `null` to set no limit for the spatial
            extent. Be careful with this when loading large datasets! It is recommended to use this parameter
            instead of using ``filter_bbox()`` or ``filter_spatial()`` directly after loading unbounded data.
        :param temporal_extent: Limits the data to load to the specified left-closed temporal interval. Applies
            to all temporal dimensions. The interval has to be specified as an array with exactly two elements:  1.
            The first element is the start of the temporal interval. The specified instance in time is **included**
            in the interval. 2. The second element is the end of the temporal interval. The specified instance in
            time is **excluded** from the interval.  The second element must always be greater/later than the first
            element. Otherwise, a `TemporalExtentEmpty` exception is thrown.  Also supports open intervals by
            setting one of the boundaries to `null`, but never both.  Set this parameter to `null` to set no limit
            for the temporal extent. Be careful with this when loading large datasets! It is recommended to use
            this parameter instead of using ``filter_temporal()`` directly after loading unbounded data.
        :param bands: Only adds the specified bands into the data cube so that bands that don't match the list
            of band names are not available. Applies to all dimensions of type `bands`.  Either the unique band
            name (metadata field `name` in bands) or one of the common band names (metadata field `common_name` in
            bands) can be specified. If the unique band name and the common name conflict, the unique band name has
            a higher priority.  The order of the specified array defines the order of the bands in the data cube.
            If multiple bands match a common name, all matched bands are included in the original order.  It is
            recommended to use this parameter instead of using ``filter_bands()`` directly after loading unbounded
            data.
        :param properties: Limits the data by metadata properties to include only data in the data cube which
            all given conditions return `true` for (AND operation).  Specify key-value-pairs with the key being the
            name of the metadata property, which can be retrieved with the openEO Data Discovery for Collections.
            The value must be a condition (user-defined process) to be evaluated against a STAC API. This parameter
            is not supported for static STAC.
