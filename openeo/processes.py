            pixels may be part of multiple geometries and be part of multiple aggregations.  To maximize
            interoperability, a nested `GeometryCollection` should be avoided. Furthermore, a `GeometryCollection`

            instead of using ``filter_bbox()`` or ``filter_spatial()`` directly after loading unbounded data.
        :param temporal_extent: Limits the data to load from the collection to the specified left-closed
            temporal interval. Applies to all temporal dimensions. The interval has to be specified as an array
            with exactly two elements:  1. The first element is the start of the temporal interval. The specified
            instance in time is **included** in the interval. 2. The second element is the end of the temporal
            interval. The specified instance in time is **excluded** from the interval.  The specified temporal
            strings follow [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html). Also supports open intervals by
            setting one of the boundaries to `null`, but never both.  Set this parameter to `null` to set no limit

            name (metadata field `name` in bands) or one of the common band names (metadata field `common_name` in
            bands) can be specified. If the unique band name and the common name conflict, the unique band name has
            a higher priority.  The order of the specified array defines the order of the bands in the data cube.
            If multiple bands match a common name, all matched bands are included in the original order.  It is
            recommended to use this parameter instead of using ``filter_bands()`` directly after loading unbounded
            data.

            all given conditions return `true` for (AND operation).  Specify key-value-pairs with the key being the
            name of the metadata property, which can be retrieved with the openEO Data Discovery for Collections.

        unchanged.    - The dimension labels, the reference system and the resolution are preserved only if the
        number of pixel values in the source dimension is equal to the number of values computed by the process.
        Otherwise, all other dimension properties change as defined in the list below. 2. The source dimension is
        not the target dimension and the latter exists:    - The number of dimensions decreases by one as the
        source dimension is dropped.    - The target dimension properties name and type remain unchanged. All other
        dimension properties change as defined in the list below. 3. The source dimension is not the target
        dimension and the latter does not exist:    - The number of dimensions remain unchanged, but the source
        dimension is replaced with the target dimension.    - The target dimension has the specified name and the
        type other. All other dimension properties are set as defined in the list below.  Unless otherwise stated
        above, for the given (target) dimension the following applies:  - the number of dimension labels is equal
        to the number of values computed by the process, - the dimension labels are incrementing integers starting
        from zero, - the resolution changes, and - the reference system is undefined.
