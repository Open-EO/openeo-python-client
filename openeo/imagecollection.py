        Applies a focal operation based on a weighted kernel to each value of the specified dimensions in the data cube.

        :param kernel: The kernel to be applied on the data cube. The kernel has to be as many dimensions as the data cube has dimensions.
        :param factor: A factor that is multiplied to each value computed by the focal operation. This is basically a shortcut for explicitly multiplying each value by a factor afterwards, which is often required for some kernel-based algorithms such as the Gaussian blur.
