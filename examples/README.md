# openEO Python Client examples

This folder originally contained various usage examples for the openEO Python client library,
meant to demonstrate how to use the openEO API in Python in the early days of the project.
However, most of these original examples were not maintained, quickly became outdated
and were moved to the `archive` folder.

For more up-to-date and more comprehensive examples,
please refer to the
[openEO Community Examples project](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-community-examples).
