    "# openEO User Workshop - Guided Session: Multi-Source Data Fusion With openEO Python Client\n",
    "\n",
    "_October 19th, 2020 - Virtual Workshop (https://openeo.org/news/2020-09-02-openeo-user-workshop.html)_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenology is an important supporting parameter of vegetation that can be derived from remote sensing data. It allows for instance to evaluate crop conditions in agriculture, or vegetation/crop type mapping and is an indicator for climate change. In this case, phenology is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start of season, a date and the corresponding value of the biophysical indicator\n",
    "* End of season, a date and the corresponding value of the biophysical indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving phenology accurately requires a vegetation index time series for a given pixel or area, \n",
    "that has both a sufficiently *high spatial resolution* (to avoid noise from sampling heterogeneous areas in a pixel or area)\n",
    "and a sufficiently *high temporal accuracy*.\n",
    "Today, no single sensor can really satisfy all these requirements, limiting the accuracy of the predicted phenology parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this openEO use case, we will demonstrate openEO's capability to implement a *multi sensor data fusion approach*\n",
    "that merges the following datasets (with different spatial and temporal resolutions)\n",
    "into a single dense vegetation index time series:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ProbaV 10-daily composites: low spatial resolution (300m), but high temporal resolution\n",
    "* Sentinel-2: high spatial resolution (10m), low temporal resolution\n",
    "* Sentinel-1 Gamma0: high spatial and temporal resolution, but no direct link to phenological parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting fused time series is then provided as input to a phenology algorithm,\n",
    "implemented as a User-Defined Function (UDF), so that it can be easily replaced with other implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give a step-by-step overview of the workflow, together with the most important openEO processes that were used to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing Sentinel-2 data\n",
    "  * Load scene classification (`load_collection`)\n",
    "  * Load bands 8 and 4 (`load_collection`)\n",
    "  * Transform scene classification to binary cloud mask (`reduce_dimension`)\n",
    "  * Dilate cloud mask (`apply_kernel`)\n",
    "  * Mask bands 8 and 4 (`mask`)\n",
    "  * Compute NDVI (`ndvi` or band math through `reduce_dimension`)\n",
    "2. Merging Sentinel-1 Gamma0: (`load_collection`/`resample_cube_spatial`/`merge_cubes`)\n",
    "3. Preprocessing and merging PROBA-V 10-daily composites to Sentinel-2 resolution (`load_collection`/`resample_cube_spatial`/`mask_polygon`/`merge_cubes`)\n",
    "4. Apply Deep learning model (GAN) to generate single NDVI (`apply_neighborhood`/`run_udf`)\n",
    "5. Pixel wise smooth the resulting time series using Savitzky–Golay filter\n",
    "6. Pixel wise derivation of phenological parameters (`apply_dimension`/`run_udf`)\n"

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is provided as a Jupyter notebook, \n",
    "but it's also possible to copy the necassary snippets into regular Python script.\n",
    "You can run your own Jupyter(Lab) environment \n",
    "or use a managed/hosted Jupyter(Lab) environment like https://notebooks.terrascope.be\n",
    "(note that you typically need a registered account for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you just need a Python (3.6 or higher) environment and the ability to install packages into that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with importing the most important packages we will be using, to get the dependency headaches out of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these imports does not work, make sure to install the related package in the Python environment of the Jupyter kernel you are using.\n",
    "Most importantly for this demonstration: install `openeo`, the [openEO Python Client Package](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client).\n",
    "If you have direct (Bash) shell access to the Python environment of your Jupyter kernel, just use pip from the command line, for example to install the latest version of `openeo`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install --upgrade openeo\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not sure about your Jupyter kernel's Python environment,\n",
    "it is also possible to install packages directly from Jupyter code cells, with a snippet like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade openeo\n",

    "The idea is that gaps in the Sentinel-2 NDVI are filled with information from the other sources. This is achieved by using a previously trained a GAN model (generative adversarial network). This is a technique that is able to reconstruct realistic looking photographs, but has also proven its use in scientific applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current model is designed such that it takes a spatio-temporal datacubes of 128x128 pixel area for all inputs with an overlap of 16 pixels. Hence, it can combine information provided by a time series of a pixel, as well as the local spatial neighbourhood of a pixel. In openEO this chunked processing can be done with the `apply_neighborhood` process.\n",
