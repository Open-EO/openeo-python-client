# openEO Python Client

Python Client Library for the [openEO API](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api).
Allows you to interact with openEO backends from your own (local) Python environment.
[Read more on usage in the documentation.](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/)

[Quick Start Guide](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/python/#installation)


## Requirements and installation

* Requirement: a **Python 3.6 (or higher) environment**
    where some dependencies can be installed
    (including usual suspects like `numpy` and `pandas`)

    Note for Windows users: it is recommended to work with
    [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    as the `shapely` dependency may need to be installed separately
    (e.g. using the Anaconda Navigator).

* Basic installation procedure (in a `pip` powered environment):

        pip install openeo
